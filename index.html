    <img style = "width: 50%;border-color: white;" src = "Sanji2.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is a project I made in photoshop in 2018. Sanji Vinsmoke is one of my favorite characters in an anime called One Piece. I decidedto try and make a cool looking design for a character that I love!</p>

    	<p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic; background-color: #bc5656; "> Comeback </p>
    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "background3.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f">  
    This project is called <i>Comeback</i> because I took a hiatus after my Photoshop class from my junior college. I stopped practicing so I decided to make myself a background for my laptop to get "back in the game." It was difficult at first but I ended up geting back in my old rhythm.</p>

    <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic;background-color: #bc5656; "> Anime Mashup </p>
    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "Malik BG6.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    After I made my background for my laptop, one of my best friends asked me if I could also make him one. Of course I said yes and I made about 6 different copies and he was finally happy with this final result.</p>

    <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic;background-color: #bc5656; ">The Red King</p>
    <img style = "width: 50%;border-color: white;" src = "Red King1.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is currently the backgroound I use for my phone screen. Shortly after I made the laptop background. I always had cool anime backgrounds so I figured I would make my own. I made it using a water overlay to create a texture over the character along with a custom paintbrush for the stars. </p>

    <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic;background-color: #bc5656; "> The King of the North </p>
    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "John Snow.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is one of my first Photoshop projects that I produced for a class of mine. I had to use certain techniques and put my own spin on it. I decided to do a John Snow poster because he is one of the greatest characters in all fiction. This project is a tribute to the greatness of John Snow.</p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This project is a dedication to one of my favorite characters in all anime. This is a show that many people do not know about so I wanted to try and capture how cool he and the show is!</p>
    
      	<p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic; background-color: #bc5656; "> Broken Background </p>
    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "Glitch.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f">  
   This piece is an art style known as Glitch Art. I created the intial image on Photoshop (the image to the left) and then took that photo and put it in an audio program called Audacity. I messed with the properties in audacity then exported it back to an image and this was the result. </p>

         <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic; background-color: #bc5656; "> EDM Logo </p>
    <img style = "width: 68%;border-color: white;" src = "MalikLogoBluePink.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f">  
   Like the image to the left, this is for my best friend who is aspiring to be am EDM DJ. He asked if I could make him a logo and he said I had complete creative control. I made this along with several other color waves. </p>

   <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic;background-color: #bc5656; "> Walk of Humor </p>
    <img style = "width: 46%;border-color: white;" src = "Mark4.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is another phone background that I made but it was for my brother. One of his favorite anime is One Punch Man so he asked if I could recreate this scene of him walking away comically after defeating his pupil. The two characters in the sky are a masking technique to blend them in the clouds.</p>

    <p style = "color: white; font-size: 72px;font-style: italic;background-color: #bc5656; "> A's All Stars </p>
    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "Ben Project3.jpg" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    Here is a piece that I made for another friend of mine. He is a die hard A's fan and wanted me to make him a backgrounf for his laptop. I created this piece using many different layer styles along with a smoke pattern overlay. I am also an A's fan myself so I was happy to do the project.</p>

    <img style = "width: 70%;border-color: white;" src = "Self Portrait.png" border="5" >
    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This self portrait was made by coding in a program called processing. The program allows you to "draw" by using shapes and or lines on a grid size of your choice. I happen to be pretty good at math so I enjoyed the program Processing.</p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is a 3D mashup that I created in a program called Meshmixer. Meshmixer allowed me to orient my objects how I wanted, then I uploaded it to Sketchfab to add colors and textures. It is also interactive on Sketchfab, so click the image to go mess with it! </p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is my first edit attempt on the program called After Effects. This video game clip is a trickshot that I actually hit on Black Ops 3. There are many trickshot edits so I decided I would try to make one myself.</p>

    <p style = "font-size: 36px;color:white;background-color: #811f1f;">  
    This is the first project that I made in Adobe Illustrator. I was in class and we were instructed to make a flier so I made up a new business. This was all done in Illustrator and it is my first complete Illustrator projet.</p>
